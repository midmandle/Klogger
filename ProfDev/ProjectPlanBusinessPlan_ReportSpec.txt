Project Plan and Business Plan interim report – guidance notes

This is typically around four sides of A4 including diagrams. The purpose of this report is to provide vision for the team, assign responsibilities and galvanise the team members.

The core of the project plan should be an “agreed” Gannt chart. The early team meetings should have the creation of this instrument, high on the agenda. The Gannt chart should be supported with text, which identifies team vision and clarifies the tasks. Typically   the project plan should be two sides of A4 including diagrams and the responsibility of the Team Leader

In addition to the project plan, the  Finance Director the Marketer are required to estimate the costs of developing and finishing the final product or service and bringing it to market.  This part of the document should be about two sides of A4. This will be further refined as the project progresses.

Merged and submitted by all and submitted as "interim report" and must be submitted by every group member by the published deadline via Moodle

 

The final “interim report” will be a point of discussion with the tutor during the Professional Development sessions.
