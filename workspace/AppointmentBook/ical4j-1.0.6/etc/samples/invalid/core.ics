SUMMARY:This Cat Roars! Experience the New Functionality in JavaTM 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM), Version 1.5
DESCRIPTION:Today JavaTM technology is everywhere -- in large enterprise systems, desktops, hand-held devices and smart cards. Consequently Java technology is the platform of choice for developers all over the world. All this has happened in the short time since the technology was first introduced in 1995. While there have been updates and enhancements since the first version, release 1.5 of the core Java platform brings to the table more language-level updates and other enhancements through the incorporation of a number of Java Specification Requests (JSRs) than at any other time. In this hands-on session, developers will learn about all these changes and how to build desktop applications using version 1.5 of the Java platform.

SUMMARY:Performance Measurement of Mixed JavaTM Technology, JIT-Compiled, and Native Applications
DESCRIPTION:Many JavaTM technology-based applications are not pure Java technology, but include JIT-compiled code, as well as native code, accessed through JNI. Performance measurement for such codes is very important, and not available with typical Java software tools. In this session we describe the implementation of an external profiling agent that profiles mixed-model Java language codes. We show how the user can collect data on such applications, and how the data can be used to analyze the application's performance.

SUMMARY:Taming the JavaTM Technology ClassLoader
DESCRIPTION:Classloaders are integral to the JavaTM technology runtime environment, providing security and dynamic class loading capabilities. Java Servlet and EJBTM containers, for example, implement their own classloaders to support features like hot deployment. Even though they mostly stay in the background, giving a hint of their presence only through the NoClassDefFoundError, there are times when problems show up as more obscure exceptions like java.lang.LinkageError. A solid understanding of classloader function is important to the ability to debug these occasional problems.

We then discuss BEA's perspective on JMX technology and on the introduction of JSR 77, JMX 1.2, and JSR 173. Finally, we explore what it would take for the JMX API to form the basis for an enterprise management solution that spans multiple vendors.

SUMMARY:Developing MIDP Applications for Different Devices
DESCRIPTION:While the MIDP platform is becoming more popular and an increasing number of devices from various vendors are supporting it, we also note that not all applications run on all devices. There are a host of reasons why: devices are unique, devices may have different screen resolutions and a varying number of colors, devices may use proprietary extensions, and there may be possible bugs in the MIDP implementation. This situation causes problems for device developers, who must write complex code or produce different versions of their applications. Sun JavaTMtechnology Studio software addresses some of these problems.

SUMMARY:Bytecode Instrumentation: Making it Simple
DESCRIPTION:Bytecode instrumentation (BCI) is easy to learn, and you can learn just how easy it is by attending this session. Bytecode instrumentation has been used since the early days of the Java platform. Today, we see it in many commercial performance tools as well as in open-source projects. In JavaTM 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM platform) version 1.5

SUMMARY:The Eclipse Modeling Framework: Introducing Modeling to the JavaTM Technology Mainstream
DESCRIPTION:Many JavaTM Technology programmers, especially the experienced ones, often have little or no use for modeling. Maybe a class diagram or two to fill out the documentation, but other than that, it simply doesn't seem to help. Well, what if there were a framework/toolkit that brought you the benefits of modeling with a very low cost of entry? Enter the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). An open source project at Eclipse.org, EMF is a framework and code generation facility for building robust applications based on surprisingly simple models. Models can be defined in several different ways—Java interfaces, XML Schemas, UML—from which EMF will generate a large part of the application. The generated code is clean, efficient, and easily hand-modified. You even can regenerate the model after changing the code, without wiping out your changes.

Tool developers could build their tools in isolation, and worry only about what they needed to do to build the best tool possible.

SUMMARY:The Impact of the J2SETM 1.5 Platform on Persistence
DESCRIPTION:Version 1.5 of the JavaTM 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM) promises to be one of the most significant releases of the platform to date. Several new features proposed for the 1.5 release will greatly impact the way architects design persistence into their applications and the way developers code for it. Persistence is often an underestimated challenge to Java software developers in complexity, effort, and maintenance. Some new features of the 1.5 release such as JSR 114 (JDBCTM RowSet Implementations) will address this challenge head-on, whereas other new features of 1.5 promise to make persistence layers and standards more developer-friendly.

This redefinition is compatible with existing good programming practice, although care needs to be taken with a couple of corner cases. More important, the new memory model provides new efficient techniques for safely and correctly implementing concurrent operations.

SUMMARY:Sun JavaTM Studio Creator Application Development Tool: The Next Generation
DESCRIPTION:With the introduction of Sun JavaTM Studio Creator application development tool (formerly code-named "Project Rave"), Sun introduced a tool and development model to corporate developers that brought the power of Java technology-based Web application creation to a large number of developers for whom the bar to entry was too high. This session looks at the up-and-coming features expected to exist in the next version of Sun's Java Studio Creator development tool, where rich clients, mobility, and closer integration with the enterprise play a significant role. During this technical session, the implications of expanding the scope of Sun's Java Studio Creator development tool for different platforms, clients, application model and components are covered in detail.

SUMMARY:What's New with JBuilder?
DESCRIPTION:This session covers various aspects of Java technology development with the latest version of JBuilder. The session shows how JBuilder accelerates the whole JavaTM technology application life cycle, starting from the requirements, coding, building unit tests, and checking the code into a version management system. The session works with the Java[TM] 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE[TM]) and builds EJB[TM] technology based applications and Struts based applications. It shows how to deploy an EJB

SUMMARY:What's New With WebLogic Workshop?
DESCRIPTION:BEA WebLogic Workshop is the next-generation development environment for visually developing and debugging JavaTM 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EETM) based Web services, Web applications, JavaServer PagesTM (JSPTM) technology-based software, portals, process workflows, and EJBTM specification-based components in a consistent, uncomplicated way. Workshop abstracts the coding and deployment complexities associated with delivering enterprise-scale J2EE technology-based applications and components, allowing developers to generate applications directly from top-down, process-driven models.

SUMMARY:The Groovy Programming Language
DESCRIPTION:JSR 241, the Groovy Programming Language, proposes the standardization of a new programming language for the JavaTM platform -- one that is on equal footing with the Java technology programming language. Groovy is an agile, dynamic programming language like Smalltalk, Python, Perl, and Ruby, but it's designed specifically for the Java platform and is completely interoperable with conventional Java technology software programs. Groovy is not a replacement for the Java technology programming language; it complements it. Groovy fills a niche that is in demand by developers but is currently not provided for in the Java platform.
