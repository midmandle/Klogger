 Frequently Asked Questions
============================


Q. What is iCal4j?

A. iCal4j consists of an iCalendar parser, object model, and generator. If you
   are looking to add iCalendar support to your Java application then iCal4j
   is for you.


Q. Are there any examples?

A. You will find most examples in the unit tests included in the "test" folder
   included with the source distribution. There are also some basic examples
   on the introduction page of the documentation, as well as in the javadocs.


Q. Is iCal4j compatible with Outlook?

A. Yes. Whilst Outlook does generate iCalendar files with abnormalities that
   don't conform to the RFC2445 specification, we have added compatibility
   flags that will correctly interpret these files. (See CompatibilityHints)


Q. Is iCal4j compatible with Mozilla Calendar/Sunbird?

A. Yes. Compatibility hints are also provided for working with Mozilla Calendar
   files.


Q. Does iCal4j support recurrence rules?

A. Yes. iCal4j is a complete implementation of the RFC2445 specification.


Q. Where does iCal4j get its timezone definitions from?

A. iCal4j includes a default set of timezone definitions, which are generated
   from the Olson database timezone definitions. You may also provide your own
   timezone definitions by providing a TimeZoneRegistry implementation (see
   TimeZoneRegistryFactory).
